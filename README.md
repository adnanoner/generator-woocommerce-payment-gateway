## What is WooCommerce Payment Gateway for Yeoman?

It's a Yeoman generator for WooCommerce plugins. Specifically, it creates a scaffold for a payment gateway plugin.

### How To Use

If you do not already have the Yeoman toolset installed do so now, and might as well install me at the same time (NOTE: don't type the $):

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-woocommerce-payment-gateway
```

And run me:

```bash
yo woocommerce-payment-gateway
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
